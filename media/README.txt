This disc can be played in a CD player for some bonus tracks. Here is the track list for
those tracks on the audio side of the disc.

1. Endure Jaminess: Botania x Space Jam submitted by MettyMagic
I made the space jam mashups as a joke one night. I was incredibly shocked to find my dumb
edits got attention from both Vazkii and Kain Vinosec, let alone included in a physical
album. Modded minecraft was a huge part of my childhood and I'm super glad to be a part of
the community in the most insignificant and comically stupid way. Thanks, everyone! -Metty

2. Runes of Mana: Fan-music submitted by Firel
This is Runes of Mana, inspired by the skyblock experience, chilling out and just vibing
to Botania's progression.  So often, I'd lose myself in the process, and just kind open my
eyes in front of the terrestrial agglomeration plate. it's nice.  I decided on the Note
Block soundfont because it lent itself very well to the nostalgic vibes.

Fan-submitted:
- cookiegd.png: Fanart submitted by CookieGD_
Botania is awesome, drawing is awesome, drawing Botania fanart is awesome too! The 10th
anniversary CD project gave me the chance to become a small part of this mods history (and
future). I hope that my obviously not very advanced art inspires other people to believe
in their skills!

- botania_wars.png: Fanart submitted by Alwinfy
I wanted to make something a bit silly. It's funny how tater started as something so
simple, but grew into such a complicated nest of inside jokes… Anyway, I hope nobody gets
mad at me for using the Play/App store logos.

- tater_hexcasting.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
I was working on Hexcasting a lot concurrently with this, so I figured I might give it
something of a shoutout. I was also working with someone from the Hex discord who was
trying to render out patterns in Blender, so this was partially my attempt to show what
the effects might look like as well.  As for the scenario, I wanted to go for a "not safe
for work" vibe. (I forgot a "multiplication" symbol during the render, but it's
embarrassing to change it now…)

- tater_holiday_2022.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
This was one of my higher-effort pieces, and the first time I tried making a multi-scene
piece with the tater involved. I wanted to give an indication of "holiday fun…" I borrowed
a few asset from Farmer's Delight, which I was enjoying at the time.  I also used the logo
in a render for the first time here, which looking back was a bit odd of me… like "isn't
this like advertising for free?" I really like the tiny potato, is all.

- tater_milk.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
This was one of my earlier creations, and one that garnered some strange looks from my
friends. I think I had been introduced to "almond milk" recently, and I'd ran with it. I
had also wanted to play with fluid simulation, and I think it turned out well. The jar I
borrowed from Supplementaries, and the milking machine I borrowed from Create's assets;
rigging it up was a lot of fun!

- tater_press.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
This was a bit of a silly build… I was somewhat procrastinating on other work at the time,
so I wanted a break. I had been playing with Create's machines (whose assets I borrowed
for this video); my idea was, "wouldn't it be silly to flatten a potato out into a plate,"
and I went from there. Mojang, add a striped flag block to the game!

- tater_shake.gif: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
Recently I'd seen a lot of posts in a more simple, low-realism style, so I tried my hand
at some model and shader work. This was when the Grimace Shake was trending too, so I
figured why not riff on it? The background was a bit nonsensical, but I think the effect
turned out well-- I was quite happy with the lighting.

- corn_entryopinnyum.png: Fanart submitted by corn27182818
For the second flower, I drew Entropinnyum. Don’t remember why, it’s definitely not a
starter flower. But it’s a neat gimmick. Also don’t remember what their design was
inspired from (maybe Helltaker or Arknights?). Red comes from TNT, at least. My headcanon
is something like “talks big about 18+ activities but actually has absolutely no
experience because they literally explode whenever they get embarrassed”.

- corn_hydroangeas.png: Fanart submitted by corn27182818
This was the first drawing I did for Botania, and I tried to make it as good as humanly
possible. And I chose Hydroangeas to draw first since it’s one of the starter flowers, so
I figured it fit the theme. The water was pretty difficult; I tried a few different
techniques, and I think it came out alright. Really took way too much time though. The
total time was close to 20 hours, one of the longest drawings I’ve ever done. That’s also
why the other drawings are a bit simpler. (I think I’ve since gotten better at not
spending excessive time on miniscule details, for the most part anyway.)

- corn_tater.png: Fanart submitted by corn27182818
I thought I ought to draw the poster child of Botania at some point. (Tater is almost a
cult, really, but an agreeable one.) I ended up making Tater a femboy. It’s ok I guess,
but I think he looks too much like Astolfo. Oh well. I was also thinking about drawing a
small comic on making french fries out of Tater, but I never got around to it.

- corn_tater-hydroangeas.png: Fanart submitted by corn27182818
Figured I’d raise some chaos by drawing random romance. I think it’s pretty cute. The pose
is from a drawing by KuroTofu /クロウトフof Frostnova x Frostleaf from Arknights
(https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/89876066). They’re quite good and their art style is
relatively simple, so I use them as reference a lot. Came out pretty good I think.
