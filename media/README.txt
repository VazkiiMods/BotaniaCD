Botania is awesome, drawing is awesome, drawing Botania fanart is awesome too! The 10th
anniversary CD project gave me the chance to become a small part of this mods history (and
future). I hope that my obviously not very advanced art inspires other people to believe
in their skills!

- Runes of Mana - Firel.flac: Fan-music submitted by Firel
This is Runes of Mana, inspired by the skyblock experience, chilling out and just vibing
to Botania's progression.  So often, I'd lose myself in the process, and just kind open my
eyes in front of the terrestrial agglomeration plate. it's nice.  I decided on the Note
Block soundfont because it lent itself very well to the nostalgic vibes.

- tater_hexcasting.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
I was working on Hexcasting a lot concurrently with this, so I figured I might give it
something of a shoutout. I was also working with someone from the Hex discord who was
trying to render out patterns in Blender, so this was partially my attempt to show what
the effects might look like as well.  As for the scenario, I wanted to go for a "not safe
for work" vibe. (I forgot a "multiplication" symbol during the render, but it's
embarrassing to change it now…)

- tater_holiday_2022.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
This was one of my higher-effort pieces, and the first time I tried making a multi-scene
piece with the tater involved. I wanted to give an indication of "holiday fun…" I borrowed
a few asset from Farmer's Delight, which I was enjoying at the time.  I also used the logo
in a render for the first time here, which looking back was a bit odd of me… like "isn't
this like advertising for free?" I really like the tiny potato, is all.

- tater_milk.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
This was one of my earlier creations, and one that garnered some strange looks from my
friends. I think I had been introduced to "almond milk" recently, and I'd ran with it. I
had also wanted to play with fluid simulation, and I think it turned out well. The jar I
borrowed from Supplementaries, and the milking machine I borrowed from Create's assets;
rigging it up was a lot of fun!

- tater_press.mp4: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
This was a bit of a silly build… I was somewhat procrastinating on other work at the time,
so I wanted a break. I had been playing with Create's machines (whose assets I borrowed
for this video); my idea was, "wouldn't it be silly to flatten a potato out into a plate,"
and I went from there. Mojang, add a striped flag block to the game!

- tater_shake.gif: Fan-animation submitted by Alwinfy
Recently I'd seen a lot of posts in a more simple, low-realism style, so I tried my hand
at some model and shader work. This was when the Grimace Shake was trending too, so I
figured why not riff on it? The background was a bit nonsensical, but I think the effect
turned out well-- I was quite happy with the lighting.
