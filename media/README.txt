Botania is awesome, drawing is awesome, drawing Botania fanart is awesome too! The 10th
anniversary CD project gave me the chance to become a small part of this mods history (and
future). I hope that my obviously not very advanced art inspires other people to believe
in their skills!

- Runes of Mana - Firel.flac: Fan-music submitted by Firel
This is Runes of Mana, inspired by the skyblock experience, chilling out and just vibing
to Botania's progression.  So often, I'd lose myself in the process, and just kind open my
eyes in front of the terrestrial agglomeration plate. it's nice.  I decided on the Note
Block soundfont because it lent itself very well to the nostalgic vibes.
