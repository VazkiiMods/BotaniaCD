1. Preface

Botania is a modification (mod) for Minecraft, themed after Natural Magic. It is classified
as a "Tech Mod", in that its gameplay centers around infrastructure design and automation.
Botania was originally created by Vazkii in 2014, and is now maintained by the Violet Moon
Modding team, specifically williewillus, Hubry, Alwinfy, and artemisSystem.

The original inspiration for Botania is lost to time, but the story I (Vazkii) usually tell,
and that I still think is correct to the best of my (weak) memory, is that I was just bored
during Biology class, and ended up doodling some ideas on my notebook, which were later
fleshed out into a mod. I don't have that notebook anymore.

Before being settled in as a mainstay of the modding community, Botania started out as a
highly controversial project in its early years due to it discarding generally accepted
gameplay conventions for mods at the time, and being designed to work as a fully standalone
experience.

Botania has had a very rocky history over its now ten year lifespan. From controversies such
as the removal of Dayblooms, hostile forks, the rise of the Tiny Potato as a community icon,
the transition through the Official/Unofficial era, failed retexture projects, having its
book entirely rewritten and moved to a different system, so on.

Over time, though, many of the design guidelines Botania followed were shown to be pioneers in 
the future of the modding ecosystem. Practices such as focusing on thorough ingame 
documentation, avoiding GUIs, and providing gameplay via puzzle pieces rather than direct 
solutions have since inspired many new mods to be created.

It's fascinating and humbling to see that even ten years after, Botania remains a popular
mainstay in the community. In some ways it gives me some pause-- thoughts of "what if that
was my peak?", and the like. I don't think it's perfect, and if you've talked to me in the
last few years about it, I've made my grievances very well known, but the fact its stood the
test of time like this shows that my distaste is mostly just the self-critic in me being overly
loud about it, I think.

Botania has solidified my name in the community and given me a place where I otherwise had none.
Even if I'm not directly working on it, its success and popularity were instrumental to charting
the course for my life for the ten years since its release, and hopefully the course continues
smooth sailing for the next ten as well. I wish to extend a massive personal thank you to all the
people involved not only in the creation of this disc, but who've contributed or enjoyed Botania
and my other mods at all over the years.

I really wouldn't be here without you.
Thank you.
- Vazkii
