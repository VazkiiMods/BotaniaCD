williewillus (Willie for short) has been modding since 2014, and got his start in high
school making Bukkit plugins and running servers for his friends. He started playing
Minecraft in version 1.0.0 and has been the primary maintainer of Botania since the
Minecraft 1.8 days (2015).

Besides working on Botania and Patchouli, Willie has also worked on the ProjectE
(2015-2019) and Twilight Forest (2017-2020) mods, and contributed in various ways to the
modded ecosystem at large by working on MCP and Yarn mappings, adding features to the mod
platforms, writing documentation and primers, and helping others with modding questions.

Lately, Willie has been seeking to wind down his Minecraft modding activities, so you'll
instead find him playing the Western flute and Chinese bamboo flute (dizi), playing Touhou
shmups, and saying hi to the regulars on IRC (#vazkii at irc.esper.net).
