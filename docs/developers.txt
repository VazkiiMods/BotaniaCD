|| Botania Developer Bios       ||
\\==============================//

This document contains brief self-introductions and bios from some past and present member
of Botania's official development and art team.

-----------
| Vazkii  |
-----------
Vazkii started playing Minecraft back in 2010, at age 12, and started modding in 2011,
at age 13, going on to create Botania in 2014. Vazkii is also the creator of several
other popular mods and modpacks, such as Psi, Quark, Neat, Patchouli, Crucial 2,
Bliss, Musketeer, and more, which were later placed under the "Violet Moon" umbrella.

Vazkii has a general distaste for the average style of gameplay Modded Minecraft
encourages, and has always pushed to move things in a different direction. This can
be seen in the fairly unique way Botania plays, and in his later push towards the
then not very popular "vanilla+" style.

These days, Vazkii mainly serves as an overseer to the Violet Moon project, which
maintains and further develops his work. You can usually find him in Granblue Fantasy
related boards and writing guides for the game.

| williewillus  |
-----------------

williewillus (Willie for short) has been modding since 2014, and got his start in high
school making Bukkit plugins and running servers for his friends. He started playing
Minecraft in version 1.0.0 and has served as the primary maintainer of Botania from the
Minecraft 1.8 days until now (2015-2024).

Besides working on Botania and Patchouli, Willie has also worked on the ProjectE
(2015-2019) and Twilight Forest (2017-2020) mods, and contributed in various ways to the
modded ecosystem at large by working on MCP and Yarn mappings, adding features to the mod
platforms, writing documentation and primers, and helping others with modding questions.

Lately, Willie has been seeking to wind down his Minecraft modding activities, so you'll
instead find him playing the Western flute and Chinese bamboo flute (dizi), playing Touhou
shmups, and saying hi to the regulars on IRC (#vazkii at irc.esper.net).

----------
| Hubry  |
----------

Hubry's first foray into Botania code in 2017 was motivated by fixing missing and
outdated information on the official FTB wiki, but a year later it turned into
contributing to the mod itself - at first focusing on mild annoyances and Thaumcraft
integration, later assisting with porting and bug fixing. Their favorite parts of
the mod are the various toys and gadgets, not the automation they have a hard time
wrapping their head around.

Currently on a hiatus, as their attention has been stolen by other games
(currently Final Fantasy XIV) but they hope to get back into modding at some point.

| Alwinfy  |
------------

alwinfy started modding in late 2019/early 2020, cleaning up some Botania code
and modernizing the Lexica Botania (it's still mostly their contributions today!)
Since then, they've worked on various quality-of-life improvements and bugfixes
for Botania and its sister mods Patchouli and Psi, as well as feature touchups
to bring Botania into a more modern age. They've also put Botania's "mascot,"
the Tiny Potato, into various situations with the power of 3D animation.

Besides Violet Moon's mods, they've worked on other mods like Hexcasting. They'd
like to get back into playing at some point, but in the meanwhile they've been
composing music, drawing, animating, building small languages, and occasionally
writing. You can generally find them in the Violet Moon discord's #tech_chat.

| artemisSystem  |
------------------

artemis, or luna, first started playing minecraft in 2012, and was introduced to
mods the same year. What followed was many years of hosting servers to play with
friends and making resource packs with various tweaks. They didn't discover
Botania until 2018, but it quickly became a favourite, and she would later go on
to become an active member of the Violet Moon community, her favourite pastime
there being discussing Botania.

In 2021, they started experimenting with making some new textures for Botania's
livingwood, which eventually made it into the mod, thanks to Hubry helping with
programming. This contributed to kicking off the full retexture of Botania by
her and Falkory, which is still an ongoing project. With the help of studying
the changes that were being made to accomodate the new textures (like making
livingwood more similar to Minecraft's other wood types), she slowly got the
hang of modding by making her own changes to Botania. After a good while of
sending bug fix and improvement patches, she was invited to be a part of the
Botania developer team. She's also made some small quality of life mods on her
own.

When it comes to playing Minecraft — which she wishes she did more often these
days — she really enjoys Crucial 2. It excellently captures their favourite way
to play the game. They aspire to make their own modpack one day, building on the
best of Crucial 2, and Vazkii's modpack design philosophy. It's good stuff.
Otherwise you'll probably find her playing Celeste or toying around (usually
with parsers) in her favourite programming language, PureScript.
