\\==============================//

This document contains brief self-introductions and bios from some past and present member
of Botania's official development and art team.

| Vazkii  |
-----------
Vazkii started playing Minecraft back in 2010, at age 12, and started modding in 2011,
at age 13, going on to create Botania in 2014. Vazkii is also the creator of several
other popular mods and modpacks, such as Psi, Quark, Neat, Patchouli, Crucial 2,
Bliss, Musketeer, and more, which were later placed under the "Violet Moon" umbrella.

Vazkii has a general distaste for the average style of gameplay Modded Minecraft
encourages, and has always pushed to move things in a different direction. This can
be seen in the fairly unique way Botania plays, and in his later push towards the
then not very popular "vanilla+" style.

These days, Vazkii mainly serves as an overseer to the Violet Moon project, which
maintains and further develops his work. You can usually find him in Granblue Fantasy
related boards and writing guides for the game.

williewillus (Willie for short) has been modding since 2014, and got his start in high
school making Bukkit plugins and running servers for his friends. He started playing
Minecraft in version 1.0.0 and served been the primary maintainer of Botania since the
Minecraft 1.8 days until now (2015-2024).

Besides working on Botania and Patchouli, Willie has also worked on the ProjectE
(2015-2019) and Twilight Forest (2017-2020) mods, and contributed in various ways to the
modded ecosystem at large by working on MCP and Yarn mappings, adding features to the mod
platforms, writing documentation and primers, and helping others with modding questions.

Lately, Willie has been seeking to wind down his Minecraft modding activities, so you'll
instead find him playing the Western flute and Chinese bamboo flute (dizi), playing Touhou
shmups, and saying hi to the regulars on IRC (#vazkii at irc.esper.net).
