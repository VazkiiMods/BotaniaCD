Botania 10th Anniversary Commemorative CD
Afterword
December XX(TODO) 2023

Hi everyone, williewillus (willie) here. I hope you enjoyed the content on this disc.

It's a minor miracle that this CD even became a real thing. I was shitposting about it
around May earlier this year, after I noticed that our 10th anniversary was coming up.
Somehow, the discussion turned serious on May 29th, 2023, and a doc was set up to
brainstorm ideas. The disc repository was created soon after on June 3rd.

Why a CD? It was my first thought of a commemorative piece of merchandise that would be
a bit more special than a T-shirt, hoodie, socks, or other clothing. I took inspiration
from doujin and Touhou culture in Asia, where passion projects often get released on CD
in a limited run and never again afterwards. One of my most prized possessions is one such
CD, the soundtrack to the Touhou fangame Elegant Impermanence of Sakura. It's just cool to
hold in your hand and know that it's one of the few in existence in the world. Likewise,
if you aren't reading this on GitHub, you are probably one of around ~200 people that will
ever actually read this message from the disc. How special is that?

We tried soliciting fanart from the community for this disc, but only a handful of
distinct people submitted works. That's okay though, the rest of you can wait for the 20th
anniversary :).

Botania has been a major part of my life for the past 9 years, and I hope it has been for
you too. Perhaps you may never load this disc into your computer ever again after you do
so for the first time (or you don't even have a disc drive), but I hope that whenever your
gaze lands on this disc sitting on your bookshelf, warm memories of Botania and Minecraft
come back to you, memories created and cherished over the past decade.

Thank you for your support,
williewillus
