This file is a list of all people who appear in Botania's contributors.properties file,
which grants them a flower hovering above their head in-game.

People can appear on this file for a variety of reasons, but it usually comes down to one
of the following:

- Developer or other special friend of the developers
- Financially supported the developers at any point through Discord, Twitch, Patreon or
  other such channels

Thank you for all of your contributions, large or small. Botania would not be where it is
today without you.
